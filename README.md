This is a simple CRUD operations example using MEAN.JS stack

Install <b>nodejs, node package manager</b> from https://nodejs.org/en/

Install <b>MongoDB</b> from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center.
Create default database and folders for MongoDB under root "data/db". Now you can start your MongoDB from bin folder of installation.
Run "mongod" for starting MongoDB server and "mongo" to start DB client.

Download <b>contactlistapp</b>. Navigate into <b>contactlistapp</b> folder. Install <b>express, mongojs and body-parser</b> using below commands.

<b>npm install express, npm install mongojs, npm install body-parser</b>

express is minimalist web framework for node.js https://github.com/expressjs/express

body-parser is node.js body parsing middleware https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser.

mongojs emulates the official mongodb API as much as possible https://github.com/mafintosh/mongojs.
